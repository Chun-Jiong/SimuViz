The general format for lattice files is the following:
“””
F
Lx, Ly, Lz

Bx
By
Bz

#Sites
S1
S2
…
…
SN

#Bonds_a (or Bonds_na)
Q1i, Q1j
Q2i, Q2j
…
…
QNi, QNj

#Plaquettes
P1i, P1j,...,P1a
P2i, P2j,...,P2b
...
...
Pni, Pnj,...,Pnm
“””

F represents the number of frames, Lx, Ly and Lz represent the size
of the lattice in the Bx, By and Bz directions respectfully.
Bx, By and Bz are basis vectors or your given lattice.

If there are sites on your lattice, please type #Sites (exactly!) and then
list the location of all of the sites in the same order on the data file:
S1, S2,…,SN.

If there is bonds with activity on, please type #Bonds_a (exactly!) and then
list all of the bond pairs as in the above example.
If there is no activity on bonds, type #Bonds_na and list the bonds in the
same manner.
It is required to list bonds in your lattice file. This is because some
calculations take into account the shortest bond length, if you do not
want to view the bonds, when the programs prompts you for a colour choice
select None.

Finally, if there are plaquettes on your lattice, please type #Plaquettes
(exactly!) and then list all of the plaquettes. Each point in one list
represents the corners of the plaquette. The program presums that the points
are ordered such a way where any two points next two each other are
connected as well as the first and last.


Notes:
-A vector should be of the form x y z where x,y,z are real numbers.
For example the zero vector is written as:
0 0 0

-The built in camera options assume that all locations
are close to the origin: 0 0 0. 

-It is critical to follow this exactly, newlines and all!
