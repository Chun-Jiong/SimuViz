The general format for lattice files is the following:
“””
Lx, Ly, Lz

Bx
By
Bz

S1
S2
…
…
SN

Q1i, Q1j
Q2i, Q2j
…
…
QNi, QNj
“””

Lx, Ly and Lz represent the size of the lattice in Bx, By and Bz
directions respectfully. Bx, By and Bz are basis vectors or your
given lattice. S1, S2,…,SN are N vectors which represent the site
locations when the lattice is broken down into its most basic form.
Q1i,Q1j,Q2i,Q2j,…,QNi,QNj are 2*N locations where a pair {Qmi,Qmj}
represents the two endpoints of a bond on the most basic form of a lattice.

Notes:
-A vector should be of the form x, y, z where x,y,z are real numbers.
For example the zero vector is written as:
0, 0, 0

-The vectors Bx, By, Bz should not contain any negative numbers.
This is because a visual error may occur where some of the bonds
aren’t displayed. This error arises in the method of determining
the locations of all bonds on the lattice.

-When start_bonds is being used it is assumed that there are no site
locations listed. Hence, do not add site lcations to those files
as an unexpected image will occur, or the program will crash.

-The camera assumes the site location and bond locations are close to the origin: 0, 0, 0. 

-The newline characters in the format are critical!
